# Causal Inference in Data Science
__A computational introduction to causality and counterfactual reasoning with Python__

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hopelessoptimism/causality-for-the-uninitiated/master)

This repository contains the exercises and data for the [Causal Inference in Data Science Live Training](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/causal-inference-in-data-science/0636920327097/). This training provides an invaluable, hands-on guide to applying causal inference in the wild to solve real-world data science tasks. Using an end-to-end example, we will walk through the process of posing a causal hypothesis, modeling our beliefs with causal graphs, estimating causal effects with the doWhy library in Python, and finally evaluating the soundness of our results. Rather than taking an abstract and mathematical approach to these steps, the focus of this training will be on accessible computational methods to practically answer causal questions in the context of a data science workflow.

## What you'll learn-and how you can apply it
* Understand how to reason causally and why it is necessary for modern data science.
* Use the doWhy library to build, estimate, and evaluate causal models.
* Learn how to practically apply causal inference to real-world data science problems.

## This training course is for you because...
* You have taken an introductory data science course or statistics course but want to take the next step to understand the foundations of causal inference and how to effectively apply the theory to real-world problems.
* You have heard about the power of causal reasoning, but do not know how to get started learning its basics or applying it to your own problems.
* You are an aspiring data scientist looking to break into the field and need to learn the practical skills necessary for what you will encounter on the job.
* You are a quantitative researcher interested in applying theory to real projects by taking a computational approach to causal inference.
* You are a software engineer interested in leveraging analytics to augment your application development process.

## Prerequisites

* Experience with an object-oriented programming language, e.g., Python (all code demos during the training will be in Python)
* Familiarity with basic probability and statistics (e.g. distributions and hypothesis testing).
* A working knowledge of the scientific Python libraries (numpy, pandas and scikit-learn) is helpful but not required.
